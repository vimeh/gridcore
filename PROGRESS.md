## Blockers
- See BLOCKERS.md for details

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [ ] ReferenceUpdater implementation from Agent-1 (for Phase 2)
- [ ] Need to verify if ReferenceParser, ReferenceAdjuster, ReferenceDetector are available

### Providing To
- [ ] Insert/delete operations infrastructure for other agents

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not run yet
- **Integration Tests**: Not run yet
- **Lint Check**: Not run yet

## Next Steps
1. Ready for Phase 4: UI Integration and Feedback
2. Add confirmation dialogs for delete operations with warnings display
3. Implement visual feedback for structural operations
4. Test end-to-end integration with actual UI components

## Notes
- Successfully integrated Agent-1's reference system from feature/absolute-refs branch
- Phase 1, 2 & 3 complete - full structural operations with formula reference updates and vim integration
- All vim commands (:insert-row, :insert-col, :delete-row, :delete-col) implemented with count support
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+Plus, Ctrl+Minus) working
- Visual mode commands (I, D) implemented for structural operations
- 37 VimBehavior tests passing, comprehensive test coverage added
- Core architecture supports warnings, viewport adjustments, and proper data integrity
