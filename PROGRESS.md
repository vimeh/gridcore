## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Phase 2 Complete - Ready for Phase 3: Find and Replace
- **Completed**: 2025-08-05
- **Status**: All Phase 2 objectives achieved

### Phase 2 Progress
- **2025-08-05 Morning**: Started Phase 2 implementation
- **10:00**: Designed comprehensive BulkOperation interfaces and base classes
- **11:00**: Implemented BatchProcessor with full transaction support and rollback
- **12:00**: Created PreviewService with caching and performance optimization
- **13:00**: Added UndoRedoManager with composite operations and memory management
- **14:00**: Implemented example BulkSetOperation demonstrating the framework
- **15:00**: Created comprehensive unit test suite (83 tests passing)
- **16:00**: Fixed import and type issues, ensured all tests pass
- **17:00**: Completed Phase 2 with full framework ready for bulk operations

## Blockers
- None - Agent 2 has completed SelectionManager APIs!

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [x] âœ… SelectionManager APIs - Agent 2 (COMPLETED!)

### Providing To
- [ ] BulkCommandParser interface for other agents
- [ ] Command mode patterns for Agent 1 (Insert/Delete Operations)

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Pass (28/28 passing for BulkCommandParser)
- **Integration Tests**: Partial (SpreadsheetController integration tests created)
- **Lint Check**: Not applicable (biome not configured in worktree)

## Next Steps
1. Start Phase 2: Design BulkOperation interface and base classes
2. Implement SelectionManager integration for hasSelection() and getAffectedCellCount()
3. Create BatchProcessor with transaction support
4. Implement operation preview system
5. Add undo/redo support for bulk operations

## Notes
- **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Successfully extended command mode infrastructure!
- **PHASE 2 COMPLETE**: Core Bulk Operation Framework fully implemented!

### Phase 1 Achievements
- Created comprehensive VimBulkCommandParser supporting all planned commands:
  * Find/Replace: `:s/pattern/replacement/g` and `:%s/pattern/replacement/g`
  * Bulk Operations: `:set value`, `:add 10`, `:mul 2`, etc.
  * Fill Operations: `:fill down`, `:fill series`, etc.
  * Transforms: `:upper`, `:lower`, `:trim`, `:clean`
  * Formatting: `:format currency`, `:format percent`
- Extended UIState with bulkOperation mode and status tracking
- Added Tab completion support in command mode
- Integrated validation with error reporting

### Phase 2 Achievements
- **Core Framework**: Designed robust BulkOperation interface with Selection, Preview, and Result types
- **Base Classes**: Created BaseBulkOperation and LazyBulkOperation for memory-efficient processing
- **BatchProcessor**: Implemented transaction-safe batch processing with conflict detection and rollback
- **PreviewService**: Built preview system with caching, timeout protection, and batch previews
- **UndoRedoManager**: Added comprehensive undo/redo with composite operations and memory management
- **CellSelection**: Implemented flexible selection system with union, intersection, and bounds operations
- **Example Implementation**: Created BulkSetOperation demonstrating the framework
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 83 unit tests covering all components with 100% pass rate
- **Performance Ready**: Framework designed to meet 100,000 cells in < 1 second target

### Ready for Phase 3: Find and Replace
- All infrastructure complete for implementing specific bulk operations
- Command parsing already supports find/replace syntax
- Preview and undo systems ready for complex operations
