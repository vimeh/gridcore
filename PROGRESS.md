## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: PASS (417/417 passing, 1297+ assertions)
- **Formula Integration Tests**: PASS (44 new tests for Phase 3)
- **Core Package Tests**: PASS (372/372 passing)
- **Lint Check**: PASS (minor CellVimBehavior duplicate from Phase 2, non-blocking)

## Phase 1 Deliverables
### Core Types and Interfaces
- `CellReference` - Supports absolute ($A$1), relative (A1), and mixed ($A1, A$1) references
- `RangeReference` - Range references with mixed absolute/relative endpoints
- `RefError` enum - Comprehensive error handling
- `AdjustmentResult` - Results of reference transformations

### Core Classes
- `ReferenceParser` - Parses all Excel-compatible reference formats including sheet references
- `ReferenceAdjuster` - Handles copy/paste adjustment, F4 cycling, and bounds checking
- `ReferenceDetector` - Analyzes formulas to find and classify all references

### Key Features Implemented
- Full Excel compatibility (A1 through XFD1048576)
- Sheet references (Sheet1!A1, 'Sheet Name'!A1)
- F4 cycling through all 4 reference types
- Copy/paste reference adjustment with bounds checking
- Formula analysis and reference detection
- Round-trip consistency (parse → stringify → parse)

## Phase 2 Deliverables
### CellVimBehavior Integration
- `ReferenceToggleExtension` - Handles F4 key cycling through reference types during formula editing
- **F4 Cycling**: A1 → $A$1 → A$1 → $A1 → A1 (Excel-compatible cycle)
- **Reference Navigation**: [r (previous reference), ]r (next reference)
- **Reference Text Objects**: ir (inner reference), ar (around reference)
- **Multi-mode Support**: Works in normal, insert, and visual modes

### Key Features Implemented
- F4 key handling integrated into CellVimBehavior for all editing modes
- Bracket commands ([r, ]r) for navigating between references in formulas
- Text object support (dir, dar, cir, car) for reference manipulation
- Integration with existing vim motion and operator system
- Comprehensive test coverage for reference behavior

## Phase 3 Deliverables
### Formula Integration
- **FormulaParser Updates** - Enhanced tokenizer to recognize $ symbols for absolute references
- **Reference Integration** - Updated AST building to use new ReferenceParser while maintaining backward compatibility
- **FormulaTransformer** - New class for adjusting references during copy/paste and fill operations
- **FormulaService Integration** - Added transformation methods to FormulaService interface and implementation
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 44 new tests covering absolute reference parsing, transformation, and edge cases

### Key Features Implemented
- Formula parsing now supports all absolute reference formats ($A$1, $A1, A$1)
- Copy/paste operations correctly adjust relative references while preserving absolute ones
- Fill operations (up, down, left, right) respect absolute reference behavior
- Preview functionality for showing transformation changes before applying
- Dependency extraction maintains compatibility while supporting new reference types
- Round-trip consistency (parse → transform → parse) for all reference types

## Phase 4 Deliverables
### UI Enhancements and Visual Highlighting
- **FormulaHighlighter Utility** - Cross-platform utility class for analyzing formulas and providing highlighting information
- **TUI FormulaBar Enhancement** - Added color-coded reference highlighting using RGB color values for terminal display
- **Web FormulaBar Overhaul** - Replaced HTML input with contenteditable div supporting rich text highlighting
- **Dynamic CSS System** - Automatic injection of highlighting styles with distinct colors for each reference type
- **Reference Tooltips** - Contextual help showing reference behavior on hover (Web UI)
- **Cursor Management** - Advanced cursor positioning preservation during highlighting updates
- **Live Highlighting** - Debounced real-time highlighting during formula editing (100ms delay)
- **Cross-Platform Colors** - Consistent color scheme across TUI and Web implementations

### Key Features Implemented
- **Visual Reference Types**: Distinct colors for relative (teal), absolute (red), mixed-column (yellow), and mixed-row (green)
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced highlighting and efficient DOM manipulation
- **Accessibility**: Tooltips explain reference behavior for better user understanding
- **Backwards Compatible**: Hidden input maintains form compatibility for Web UI
- **Rich Editing**: Paste handling preserves plain text while maintaining highlighting
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 17 tests for FormulaHighlighter with 50+ assertions covering all functionality

## Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 4: Add F4 cycling visual feedback and comprehensive UI tests
2. Begin Phase 5: Command Mode Integration for bulk reference operations
3. Implement Phase 6: Fill Operations with visual reference adjustment feedback
