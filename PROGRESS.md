## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Phase 1 Final Integration Testing
- **Started**: 2025-08-04 13:30
- **Expected Completion**: 2025-08-04 EOD

### Today's Progress
- 10:00: Examined SelectionManager APIs from Agent 2 - COMPLETED!
- 10:15: Reviewed existing VimBehavior and SpreadsheetController command infrastructure
- 10:30: Started Phase 1 - Extending command mode for bulk operations
- 11:00: Created VimBulkCommandParser with full vim-style command support
- 11:30: Extended UIState and UIStateMachine for bulk operations
- 12:00: Integrated BulkCommandParser with SpreadsheetController
- 12:30: Added command completion and validation support
- 13:00: Created comprehensive unit tests (28 tests passing)
- 13:30: Committed Phase 1 implementation

## Blockers
- None - Agent 2 has completed SelectionManager APIs!

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [x] âœ… SelectionManager APIs - Agent 2 (COMPLETED!)

### Providing To
- [ ] BulkCommandParser interface for other agents
- [ ] Command mode patterns for Agent 1 (Insert/Delete Operations)

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Pass (28/28 passing for BulkCommandParser)
- **Integration Tests**: Partial (SpreadsheetController integration tests created)
- **Lint Check**: Not applicable (biome not configured in worktree)

## Next Steps
1. Start Phase 2: Design BulkOperation interface and base classes
2. Implement SelectionManager integration for hasSelection() and getAffectedCellCount()
3. Create BatchProcessor with transaction support
4. Implement operation preview system
5. Add undo/redo support for bulk operations

## Notes
- **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Successfully extended command mode infrastructure!
- Created comprehensive VimBulkCommandParser supporting all planned commands:
  * Find/Replace: `:s/pattern/replacement/g` and `:%s/pattern/replacement/g`
  * Bulk Operations: `:set value`, `:add 10`, `:mul 2`, etc.
  * Fill Operations: `:fill down`, `:fill series`, etc.
  * Transforms: `:upper`, `:lower`, `:trim`, `:clean`
  * Formatting: `:format currency`, `:format percent`
- Extended UIState with bulkOperation mode and status tracking
- Added Tab completion support in command mode
- Integrated validation with error reporting
- Ready to move to Phase 2: Core Bulk Operation Framework
- Performance target: Update 100,000 cells in < 1 second (Phase 3 goal)
