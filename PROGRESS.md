### Providing To
- [ ] [What others need from this agent]

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: PASS (45/45 passing, 182 assertions)
- **Integration Tests**: N/A (Phase 1 focus on core logic)
- **Lint Check**: PASS (after fixing naming conflicts)

## Phase 1 Deliverables
### Core Types and Interfaces
- `CellReference` - Supports absolute ($A$1), relative (A1), and mixed ($A1, A$1) references
- `RangeReference` - Range references with mixed absolute/relative endpoints
- `RefError` enum - Comprehensive error handling
- `AdjustmentResult` - Results of reference transformations

### Core Classes
- `ReferenceParser` - Parses all Excel-compatible reference formats including sheet references
- `ReferenceAdjuster` - Handles copy/paste adjustment, F4 cycling, and bounds checking
- `ReferenceDetector` - Analyzes formulas to find and classify all references

### Key Features Implemented
- Full Excel compatibility (A1 through XFD1048576)
- Sheet references (Sheet1!A1, 'Sheet Name'!A1)
- F4 cycling through all 4 reference types
- Copy/paste reference adjustment with bounds checking
- Formula analysis and reference detection
- Round-trip consistency (parse → stringify → parse)

## Phase 2 Deliverables
### CellVimBehavior Integration
- `ReferenceToggleExtension` - Handles F4 key cycling through reference types during formula editing
- **F4 Cycling**: A1 → $A$1 → A$1 → $A1 → A1 (Excel-compatible cycle)
- **Reference Navigation**: [r (previous reference), ]r (next reference)
- **Reference Text Objects**: ir (inner reference), ar (around reference)
- **Multi-mode Support**: Works in normal, insert, and visual modes

### Key Features Implemented
- F4 key handling integrated into CellVimBehavior for all editing modes
- Bracket commands ([r, ]r) for navigating between references in formulas
- Text object support (dir, dar, cir, car) for reference manipulation
- Integration with existing vim motion and operator system
- Comprehensive test coverage for reference behavior

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3: Formula Integration
2. Update FormulaParser to handle absolute references
3. Implement FormulaTransformer for reference adjustment
