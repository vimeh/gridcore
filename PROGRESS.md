- 2025-01-04: Added insert/delete modes to UIState with factory functions and type guards
- 2025-01-04: Extended UIStateMachine with structural transitions
- 2025-01-04: Extended SpreadsheetController with insert/delete operation handlers
- 2025-01-04: Created and passed basic functional tests
- 2025-01-04: ✅ COMPLETED Phase 2 implementation  
- 2025-01-04: Integrated Agent-1's reference system from feature/absolute-refs branch
- 2025-01-04: Implemented ReferenceUpdater wrapper for formula updates during structural changes
- 2025-01-04: Created SparseGrid for efficient insert/delete data operations
- 2025-01-04: Built StructuralEngine with warning system and viewport adjustment logic

## Blockers
- See BLOCKERS.md for details

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [ ] ReferenceUpdater implementation from Agent-1 (for Phase 2)
- [ ] Need to verify if ReferenceParser, ReferenceAdjuster, ReferenceDetector are available

### Providing To
- [ ] Insert/delete operations infrastructure for other agents

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not run yet
- **Integration Tests**: Not run yet
- **Lint Check**: Not run yet

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3: VimBehavior Integration
2. Add structural commands to VimBehavior (gir, giR, gic, giC, dr, dc)
3. Implement count support for bulk operations
4. Add confirmation flow for delete operations

## Notes
- Successfully integrated Agent-1's reference system from feature/absolute-refs branch
- Phase 1 & 2 complete - full structural operations with formula reference updates
- Ready for Phase 3: VimBehavior Integration
- Core architecture supports warnings, viewport adjustments, and proper data integrity
