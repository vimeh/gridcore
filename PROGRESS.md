# Progress Report

## Agent Information
- **Feature**: Formula Fill and Extend Operations
- **Agent**: Agent-5
- **Worktree**: /Users/vinay/v/code/gridcore/worktrees/formula-fill
- **Start Date**: 2025-08-04
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-04 (Initial Start)

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 1 of 6
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Completion**: 5%

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Phase 0: Initial Setup
  - [x] Read agent instructions and plan
  - [x] Examine current UIState structure
  - [x] Examine current VimBehavior implementation
  - [x] Review ReferenceAdjuster availability (NOTED: Not yet implemented by Agent-1)
- [ ] Phase 1: Extend UIState and VimBehavior (Days 1-2)
  - [ ] Task 1.1: Add fill mode to UIState discriminated union
  - [ ] Task 1.2: Create fill state factory functions
  - [ ] Task 1.3: Add fill commands to VimBehavior (Ctrl+d, gfd, gfr, gF)
  - [ ] Task 1.4: Implement fill transitions in UIStateMachine
  - [ ] Task 1.5: Write unit tests for state transitions
- [ ] Phase 2: Core Fill Engine (Days 2-4)
  - [ ] Task 2.1: Implement basic fill operations in SpreadsheetController
  - [ ] Task 2.2: Create pattern detection framework
  - [ ] Task 2.3: Build formula adjustment system
  - [ ] Task 2.4: Add fill options structure
  - [ ] Task 2.5: Write unit tests

## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Task 1.1 - Add fill mode to UIState discriminated union
- **Started**: 2025-08-04
- **Expected Completion**: Today

### Today's Progress
- 10:00: Read instructions and plan documentation
- 10:15: Examined existing UIState structure and VimBehavior
- 10:30: Started implementing fill mode state

## Blockers
- None currently. Note: ReferenceAdjuster from Agent-1 not yet available but can work on pattern detection independently

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [ ] ReferenceAdjuster implementation - Agent-1 (for formula adjustment)

### Providing To
- [ ] Fill state management for UI components
- [ ] Pattern detection algorithms for other agents
- [ ] Fill engine for SpreadsheetController

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not run yet
- **Integration Tests**: Not run yet
- **Lint Check**: Not run yet

## Next Steps
1. Add fill mode to UIState discriminated union
2. Create fill state factory functions
3. Add fill commands to VimBehavior
4. Implement state machine transitions
5. Write unit tests

## Notes
- ReferenceAdjuster dependency noted as not yet implemented
- Can proceed with pattern detection and basic fill operations independently
- Focus on core functionality first due to LOW priority status
