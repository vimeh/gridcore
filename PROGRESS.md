## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Task 1.1: Create BulkCommandParser for command mode
- **Started**: 2025-08-04
- **Expected Completion**: 2025-08-04 EOD

### Today's Progress
- 10:00: Examined SelectionManager APIs from Agent 2 - COMPLETED!
- 10:15: Reviewed existing VimBehavior and SpreadsheetController command infrastructure
- 10:30: Starting Phase 1 - Extending command mode for bulk operations

## Blockers
- None - Agent 2 has completed SelectionManager APIs!

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [x] âœ… SelectionManager APIs - Agent 2 (COMPLETED!)

### Providing To
- [ ] BulkCommandParser interface for other agents
- [ ] Command mode patterns for Agent 1 (Insert/Delete Operations)

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not started
- **Integration Tests**: Not started
- **Lint Check**: Not started

## Next Steps
1. Create BulkCommandParser class in packages/ui-core/src/commands/
2. Implement vim-style command parsing (:s/pattern/replacement/g)
3. Add bulk operation actions to UIStateMachine
4. Integrate BulkCommandParser with SpreadsheetController
5. Write unit tests for command parsing

## Notes
- Great news: Agent 2 has completed SelectionManager with all required APIs!
- Available SelectionManager methods:
  * getSelectedCells(): Set<string>
  * getSelectionRange(): CellRange | null
  * isSelected(cell: CellAddress): boolean
  * getActiveCell(): CellAddress | null
- Command mode already exists in SpreadsheetController - need to extend it
- Performance target: Update 100,000 cells in < 1 second

## Commits
- Will start committing after creating BulkCommandParser
