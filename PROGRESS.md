## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Implement SelectionManager class
- **Started**: 2025-08-04 13:00
- **Expected Completion**: Today

### Today's Progress
- 11:00: Read agent instructions and full plan
- 11:15: Examined existing UIState and VimBehavior structures
- 11:30: Started Phase 1 - UIState extensions
- 12:00: Completed UIState discriminated union extension with visual mode
- 12:15: Added VimBehavior support for V, gC, and Ctrl+v commands
- 12:30: Implemented UIStateMachine transitions for visual modes
- 12:45: Added comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
- 13:00: Phase 1 complete! Starting Phase 2 - SelectionManager implementation

## Blockers
- None

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- None - this is a foundational feature

### Providing To
- [ ] SelectionManager for Agent-4 (bulk-ops) - Expected completion of Phase 2

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not yet run
- **Integration Tests**: Not yet run
- **Lint Check**: Not yet run

## Next Steps
1. Add visual selection mode to UIState discriminated union
2. Create selection types and factory functions
3. Extend VimBehavior with visual mode commands
4. Add state transitions for visual modes
5. Write unit tests for new functionality

## Notes
- Existing UIState has discriminated union pattern that's perfect for extension
- VimBehavior already has visual mode handling but only for cell-level editing
- Need to add spreadsheet-level visual selection mode for column/row selection
- Current visual mode in VimBehavior is cell-level, need to extend for spreadsheet-level

## Commits
