## Current Work
### Active Task
- **Task**: Verifying Agent-1 ReferenceUpdater dependencies for Phase 2
- **Started**: 2025-01-04
- **Expected Completion**: 2025-01-04

### Today's Progress
- 2025-01-04: Examined existing UIState and SpreadsheetController structure
- 2025-01-04: Set up progress tracking and todo system
- 2025-01-04: âœ… COMPLETED Phase 1 implementation
- 2025-01-04: Added insert/delete modes to UIState with factory functions and type guards
- 2025-01-04: Extended UIStateMachine with structural transitions
- 2025-01-04: Extended SpreadsheetController with insert/delete operation handlers
- 2025-01-04: Created and passed basic functional tests

## Blockers
- See BLOCKERS.md for details

## Dependencies
### Waiting On
- [ ] ReferenceUpdater implementation from Agent-1 (for Phase 2)
- [ ] Need to verify if ReferenceParser, ReferenceAdjuster, ReferenceDetector are available

### Providing To
- [ ] Insert/delete operations infrastructure for other agents

## Test Results
- **Unit Tests**: Not run yet
- **Integration Tests**: Not run yet
- **Lint Check**: Not run yet

## Next Steps
1. Verify Agent-1's ReferenceUpdater implementation status
2. Begin Phase 2: Core Infrastructure implementation
3. Create SparseGrid data structure for efficient operations
4. Implement ReferenceUpdater integration for formula adjustments

## Notes
- Agent 1 supposedly completed ReferenceUpdater, but no reference files found in packages/core/src/references/
- Need to check if reference handling code exists or needs to be created for Phase 2
- Starting with Phase 1 as instructed - UI state management independent of reference updates
