### Phase 6: Implementation Details

#### 6.1 Demo Runner Architecture
```rust
pub struct DemoRunner {
    scenarios: Vec<Box<dyn DemoScenario>>,
    current_scenario: Option<usize>,
    performance_monitor: PerformanceMonitor,
    playback_speed: f32,
    state: DemoState,
}

pub trait DemoScenario {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn description(&self) -> &str;
    fn setup(&mut self, controller: &mut SpreadsheetController);
    fn run_step(&mut self, controller: &mut SpreadsheetController) -> StepResult;
    fn cleanup(&mut self, controller: &mut SpreadsheetController);
}
```

#### 6.2 Performance Monitor
```rust
pub struct PerformanceMonitor {
    fps_counter: FpsCounter,
    memory_tracker: MemoryTracker,
    operation_timer: OperationTimer,
    metrics_history: VecDeque<Metrics>,
}
```

### Phase 7: Testing Strategy

#### 7.1 Automated Tests
- Each scenario has success criteria
- Performance regression tests
- Memory leak detection
- Error handling verification

#### 7.2 Manual Testing
- Visual inspection of demos
- Performance feel testing
