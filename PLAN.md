This is a fantastic and ambitious goal. I love it. Building your own spreadsheet application from the ground up is the ultimate way to achieve the control and flexibility you're looking for. It's a serious undertaking, but incredibly rewarding.

Let's architect this properly. The key to your "terminal, browser, and desktop" requirement is a clean separation of concerns. We will design a **headless core engine** that contains all the logic, and then build separate "heads" or "frontends" for each platform.

Here is a strategic roadmap, broken down into logical milestones.

______________________________________________________________________

### **The Grand Plan: The "Hydra" Architecture**

We'll call this the Hydra Architecture: one powerful core (the body) with multiple frontends (the heads).

- **The Core Engine (The Body):** A pure, dependency-free library written in a language that can run anywhere. It will handle all the logic: the grid data structure, formula calculations, state management (like undo/redo), and provide a clean API. It knows *nothing* about how it's being displayed.
- **The Heads (The Frontends):**
  1. **Terminal UI (TUI):** A command-line interface.
  1. **Browser UI (GUI):** A web-based graphical interface.
  1. **Desktop UI (GUI):** A native-feeling desktop application.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Milestone 0: Foundation & Setup**

Before writing a single line of spreadsheet code, we set the stage.

1. **Choose Your Language:** For maximum cross-platform compatibility, **TypeScript/JavaScript** is the undisputed champion.

   - The **Core Engine** can be a Node.js package.
   - The **TUI** can run directly in Node.js.
   - The **Browser UI** runs natively in the browser.
   - The **Desktop UI** can be built with Electron or Tauri, which reuse the Browser UI.
   - This gives you a single language for the entire stack.

1. **Project Structure: The Monorepo:** This is non-negotiable for a project like this. A monorepo allows you to manage the `core` package and all the `ui` packages in a single repository.

   - **Tools:** Use `pnpm workspaces` (recommended for efficiency), `Nx`, or `Turborepo`.
   - **Initial Structure:**
     ```
     /my-spreadsheet
       /packages
         /core       <-- The headless engine
         /ui-tui     <-- The terminal UI
         /ui-web     <-- The browser UI
         /ui-desktop <-- The desktop app
       package.json
       pnpm-workspace.yaml
     ```

1. **Name Your Project:** Give your creation a name! Let's call it **"GridCore"** for this roadmap.

### **Milestone 1: The Headless `core` Engine (The Hardest Part)**

This is where we build the brain. No visuals yet. The goal is to create a library that can be tested and verified entirely from a test suite.

1. **The Grid Data Structure:**

   - **Goal:** Create a class or module that holds the state of the sheet.
   - **V1:** Start with a simple 2D array to represent the cells: `cells[row][col]`.
   - **V2 (Optimization):** For efficiency, move to a sparse map, like `Map<"R1C1", CellObject>`, so you only store data for cells that aren't empty.
   - **The `Cell` Object:** Define the structure of a cell: `{ rawValue: string, computedValue: any, formula?: string, style?: object }`.

1. **The Formula Parser:**

   - **Goal:** Turn a formula string like `"=SUM(A1:B2) * C3"` into a computer-readable structure (an Abstract Syntax Tree or AST).
   - **CRITICAL:** Do not try to parse this with regular expressions. It will lead to madness.
   - **Action:** Use a proper parser generator library like **`nearley.js`** or **`chevrotain`**. You'll define a grammar for your formula language (e.g., "a formula is an equals sign followed by an expression," "an expression can be a number, a cell reference, or a function call").

1. **The Calculation Engine & Dependency Graph:**

   - **Goal:** Evaluate the AST from the parser and manage recalculations.
   - **Dependency Graph:** This is the magic of a spreadsheet. When a formula is set (e.g., in cell `C4`, formula is `=A1+A2`), you parse it, identify its dependencies (`A1`, `A2`), and store this in a graph: `C4 -> [A1, A2]`.
   - **Calculation Logic:** When a cell's value changes (e.g., user types `10` in `A1`), you look up the dependency graph to see which cells depend on `A1` (in this case, `C4`). You then trigger a recalculation for `C4` and any cells that depend on `C4`, and so on. This is called a "topological sort" of the graph's dependents.

1. **The Public API:**

   - **Goal:** Define the clean interface that the UIs will use to talk to the core.
   - **Functions:** `gridCore.setCellValue(row, col, value)`, `gridCore.getCell(row, col)`, `gridCore.getComputedValue(row, col)`, `gridCore.on('update', callback)`.

1. **Undo/Redo Stack:**

   - **Goal:** Implement undo/redo functionality.
   - **Action:** Use the **Command Pattern**. Every action (like `setCellValue`) becomes a command object with an `execute()` and `undo()` method. You push these commands onto a stack. Undo pops from the stack and calls `undo()`. Redo moves it back and calls `execute()`.

### **Milestone 2: The First Head - Terminal UI (TUI)**

Why the TUI first? It's the simplest view. It forces you to rely *only* on your `core` API and proves that your engine is truly headless.

1. **Choose a TUI Library:** Use a library like **`blessed`** or **`Ink`** (if you like React).
1. **Render the Grid:** Write code to draw the grid state from `core` onto the terminal screen.
1. **Implement Navigation:** Capture keyboard arrow keys to move the active cell cursor.
1. **Implement Editing:** When the user presses `Enter`, capture their input, and call `gridCore.setCellValue(...)`.
1. **Connect to Updates:** Use the `gridCore.on('update', ...)` event to know when to re-render the TUI.

### **Milestone 3: The Second Head - Browser UI (GUI)**

This is the most visually complex part.

1. **Rendering with Virtualization:**

   - **Goal:** Render a grid that can handle thousands of rows without crashing the browser.
   - **DO NOT** render a giant HTML `<table>`.
   - **Action:** Use **`<canvas>` rendering**. This is the professional approach (used by Google Sheets, Figma). You only draw the portion of the grid that is currently visible in the viewport. As the user scrolls, you redraw the canvas with the new visible cells. This is called **virtualization**.

1. **Interaction Layer:**

   - **Selection:** Handle `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events on the canvas to calculate which cells are being selected.
   - **Editing:** On `dblclick`, create an `<input type="text">` element and position it perfectly on top of the cell's location on the canvas. When the user is done editing, grab the value and send it to `gridCore`.

1. **Component Framework:** Use a framework like React, Svelte, or Vue to structure your UI components (the formula bar, toolbars, etc.).

### **Milestone 4: The Third Head - Desktop UI**

This milestone should be surprisingly easy if Milestone 3 was done well.

1. **Choose a Framework:**
   - **Tauri (Recommended):** Modern, secure, and uses the OS's native web renderer, resulting in smaller, faster apps.
   - **Electron:** More mature and widely used, but bundles a full Chromium browser, making apps larger.
1. **Wrap the Web App:** Both frameworks essentially act as a wrapper for your Browser UI. You can reuse almost all of your `ui-web` code. The main difference is that the desktop app can interact with the local file system directly for saving and opening files.

### **Milestone 5: Advanced Features (The Fun Part)**

Once the core and heads are working, you can start adding features that make a spreadsheet powerful.

- **Persistence:** Define a file format (start with simple JSON) to save and load your spreadsheets.
- **Styling & Formatting:** Extend the `Cell` object to include style information (bold, italics, colors, number formats like currency/date) and implement the rendering for it.
- **Charts:** Integrate a charting library (like `Chart.js`) that can read data from your `core`.
- **More Functions:** Add more functions to your formula engine (`IF`, `VLOOKUP`, `AVERAGE`, etc.).

### **Milestone 6: The AI Layer**

Now, you can finally add the AI capabilities you originally wanted, but on *your* terms.

1. **Define an AI Function:** Create a special function in your formula engine, e.g., `=AI("Summarize the text in A1:A10")`.
1. **Async Calculation:** When your calculation engine encounters this function, it makes an `async` API call to an AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
1. **Update on Response:** The cell's `computedValue` can initially be "Thinking..." and then update automatically once the API responds. The `core` engine's event emitter will notify the UI to re-render the cell.

This roadmap is a multi-month, or even multi-year, journey. But by following this structured, decoupled approach, you will build a robust, flexible, and truly multi-platform application that you have complete control over. Good luck, and enjoy the process
