## Risk Assessment

| Risk                                | Impact | Mitigation                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Breaking changes during refactoring | High   | Comprehensive test coverage, incremental changes |
| Performance regression              | Medium | Benchmarking before/after, profiling             |
| Incomplete refactoring              | Medium | Phased approach, tracking document               |
| Team resistance                     | Low    | Clear documentation, gradual rollout             |

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All tests passing after each phase
- ✅ Zero panic! in production code
- ✅ \<100 .unwrap() calls (test-only)
- ✅ No file >500 lines
- ✅ Clear module boundaries
- ✅ Improved performance metrics
- ✅ 90%+ test coverage

## Notes

- Priority is safety (removing panic!/unwrap) over architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document all architectural decisions
- Keep tests green throughout refactoring
