# GridCore Refactoring Progress

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Viewport Management
- ‚úÖ Moved `ViewportBounds`, `ScrollPosition`, and `CellPosition` types from UI to controller
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `ViewportManager` trait with comprehensive viewport operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented full viewport management in `DefaultViewportManager`
- ‚úÖ Added scroll management, cell position calculations, and visibility checks

### Phase 2: Configuration Split
- ‚úÖ Created `GridConfiguration` struct in controller for structural properties
- ‚úÖ Split `GridTheme` to only contain visual properties (colors, fonts, padding)
- ‚úÖ Integrated `GridConfiguration` into `SpreadsheetController`
- ‚úÖ Added utility functions for column label conversion

### Phase 3: Resize Management
- ‚úÖ Created `ResizeManager` in controller for column/row resize operations
- ‚úÖ Added resize state tracking and limits enforcement
- ‚úÖ Integrated `ResizeManager` into `SpreadsheetController`
- ‚úÖ Added unit tests for resize functionality

### Test Fixes
- ‚úÖ Updated controller tests to match new architecture
- ‚úÖ Fixed mode transition tests for new state management
- ‚úÖ Added Insert mode keyboard handler

## Remaining Tasks üìã

### UI Integration
- ‚è≥ Update `canvas_grid.rs` to use controller's `GridConfiguration`
- ‚è≥ Replace UI `Viewport` with controller's `ViewportManager`
- ‚è≥ Update resize handler to use controller's `ResizeManager`
- ‚è≥ Refactor mouse/keyboard event handling to delegate to controller

### Event System
- ‚è≥ Complete keyboard event delegation to controller
- ‚è≥ Move mouse event business logic to controller
- ‚è≥ Ensure UI only captures events and renders

### Testing & Validation
- ‚è≥ Fix remaining reference toggle tests
- ‚è≥ Run full test suite across all packages
- ‚è≥ Test WASM compilation
- ‚è≥ Manual testing of UI interactions

## Architecture Summary

### Current State
The refactoring has successfully established clear separation of concerns:

**gridcore-core** (‚úÖ No changes needed)
- Pure spreadsheet engine
- Formula evaluation
- Cell calculations
- No UI dependencies

**gridcore-controller** (‚úÖ Enhanced)
- `ViewportManager`: All viewport state and calculations
- `GridConfiguration`: Structural properties (dimensions, limits)
- `ResizeManager`: Column/row resize operations
- `SelectionManager`: Selection state (already existed)
- Event interpretation and state management

**gridcore-ui** (‚è≥ Needs updates)
- `GridTheme`: Visual properties only
- Event capture and forwarding
- Rendering based on controller state
- Currently still contains some business logic to be moved

## Next Steps

1. **Update UI Components** (Priority: High)
   - Modify `canvas_grid.rs` to use controller's viewport
   - Update all theme references to use `GridConfiguration` from controller
   - Simplify viewport wrapper to delegate all operations

2. **Complete Event Handling** (Priority: Medium)
   - Move remaining keyboard logic to controller
   - Simplify mouse event handling in UI

3. **Testing** (Priority: High)
   - Fix remaining test failures
   - Add integration tests for refactored components
   - Ensure WASM builds correctly

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Business logic now resides in controller, not UI
2. **Reusability**: Controller can support multiple UI implementations
3. **Testability**: Business logic can be tested without UI dependencies
4. **Maintainability**: Each layer has clear responsibilities

## Migration Guide for UI Components

When updating UI components:

1. Replace `GridTheme` structural properties with `controller.get_config()`
2. Use `controller.get_viewport_manager()` for viewport operations
3. Use `controller.get_resize_manager()` for resize operations
4. Forward keyboard/mouse events to controller for interpretation
5. React to controller events for state changes
