# State Reduction Plan for GridCore UI

## Overview

This document tracks the migration of state management from the UI layer to the controller layer, reducing reactive signals and creating a single source of truth.

## Current Issues

- Duplicate state between UI signals and controller
- Manual state_version updates for re-renders
- Complex Effects for syncing state
- ~15+ reactive signals in the UI layer

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Event-Driven Updates âœ…

- [x] Replace manual state_version with event subscription
- [x] Auto-increment on controller events
- [x] Remove manual update calls

### Phase 2: Active Cell & Mode Consolidation âœ…

- [x] Sync active_cell signal from controller.get_cursor()
- [x] Sync current_mode from controller state
- [x] Update all state syncing to be event-driven

### Phase 3: Unit Testing âœ…

- [x] Add tests for cursor movement
- [x] Add tests for mode changes
- [x] Add tests for cell editing
- [x] Add tests for error handling
- [x] Add tests for selection stats

### Phase 4: Formula Bar Migration ðŸš§

- [ ] Add formula bar state to controller
- [ ] Create FormulaBarUpdate action
- [ ] Move submission logic to controller
- [ ] Remove formula_value signal

### Phase 5: Selection & Stats

- [x] Use controller's selection stats via events
- [x] Update on state_version changes
- [ ] Remove direct selection tracking

### Phase 6: Sheet Management

- [ ] Add sheet list to SpreadsheetFacade
- [ ] Implement sheet CRUD operations
- [ ] Add sheet events to controller
- [ ] Remove sheets signal

### Phase 7: Canvas Grid Simplification

- [ ] Derive editing_mode from UIState
- [ ] Get cell_position from ViewportManager
- [ ] Derive cursor_style from controller state
- [ ] Remove local signals

### Phase 8: Error Consolidation

- [ ] Add error queue to controller
- [ ] Centralize error dispatching
- [ ] Remove error signals from UI

### Phase 9: Viewport Direct Access

- [ ] Remove viewport wrapper signal
- [ ] Direct ViewportManager access
- [ ] Update rendering to use controller

## Progress Tracking

| Component  | Signals Before | Signals After | Status      |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| App.rs     | 10             | 8             | Complete    |
| CanvasGrid | 5              | 5             | Pending     |
| CellEditor | 2              | 2             | Pending     |
| TabBar     | 4              | 4             | Pending     |
| StatusBar  | 0              | 0             | Complete    |

## Metrics

- **Total Signals Before**: ~15
- **Target Signals After**: 2-3
- **Code Reduction**: ~500 lines
- **Performance**: Fewer reactive updates

## Testing Checklist

- [x] All keyboard navigation works
- [x] Formula bar updates correctly
- [x] Mode transitions smooth
- [x] Cell editing functional
- [x] Selection stats accurate
- [x] Error display works
- [x] Canvas renders correctly
- [ ] Sheet switching works

## Notes

- Controller becomes single source of truth
- UI layer only renders, no business logic
- All state changes through Actions
- Events drive UI updates

## Completed Work

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All UI updates now triggered by controller events
2. **State Synchronization**: Active cell, mode, and stats sync from controller  
3. **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive unit tests for event system
4. **Reduced Coupling**: UI no longer directly manipulates state

## Next Steps

1. Move formula bar logic to controller
2. Implement sheet management in core
3. Simplify canvas grid signals
4. Consolidate error handling
