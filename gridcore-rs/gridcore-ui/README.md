# GridCore Leptos UI

A Rust-based spreadsheet UI built with Leptos framework, migrating from the TypeScript implementation.

## Current Status

âœ… **Phase 1: Basic Setup Complete**
- Trunk build configuration
- Leptos project structure  
- Basic app shell with placeholder UI
- CSS styling framework
- Successful WASM compilation

## Architecture

The Leptos UI provides direct integration with Rust controllers, eliminating WASM wrapper overhead:

```
gridcore-ui/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs           # Entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.rs            # Main App component (placeholder)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # UI components (to be implemented)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rendering/        # Canvas rendering (to be implemented)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ interaction/      # Event handlers (to be implemented)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/            # DOM utilities (to be implemented)
â”œâ”€â”€ style/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.css          # Styles
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html            # HTML template
â””â”€â”€ Trunk.toml            # Build configuration
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust (stable)
- Trunk: `cargo install trunk`

### Build and Run
```bash
# Development server with hot reload
trunk serve

# Production build
trunk build --release
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### âœ… Completed
- Project setup and configuration
- Basic Leptos app structure
- Trunk build system
- CSS framework

### ðŸš§ Next Steps

#### Phase 2: Core Components
- [ ] Implement working CanvasGrid with web-sys
- [ ] Port Viewport calculations
- [ ] Basic grid rendering

#### Phase 3: Interaction
- [ ] Mouse event handling
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Cell selection

#### Phase 4: Editing
- [ ] Cell editor component
- [ ] Formula bar
- [ ] Vim mode support

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Column/row resizing
- [ ] Sheet tabs
- [ ] Status bar with modes

## Key Benefits Over TypeScript Version

1. **No WASM Boundary** - Direct access to Rust controllers
2. **Type Safety** - Compile-time guarantees across entire stack
3. **Performance** - Native Rust performance for calculations
4. **Smaller Bundle** - Single WASM module instead of multiple

## Technical Notes

### Canvas Rendering
Uses web-sys for direct canvas API access, maintaining pixel-perfect rendering from the TypeScript version.

### State Management
Leptos signals provide reactive state management, directly integrated with the SpreadsheetController.

### Event Handling
Native Rust event handlers with direct controller integration, no serialization needed.

## Migration from TypeScript

The migration preserves the architecture while leveraging Rust's strengths:

| TypeScript Component | Rust/Leptos Component | Status |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| CanvasGrid.ts | canvas_grid.rs | Scaffold created |
| Viewport.ts | viewport.rs | Basic implementation |
| CellEditor.ts | cell_editor.rs | Scaffold created |
| SelectionManager.ts | Uses Rust SelectionManager | Direct integration |
| WebStateAdapter.ts | Direct UIStateMachine | No adapter needed |

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with browser testing
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

## Contributing

The UI is being migrated incrementally. Focus areas:
1. Canvas rendering with web-sys
2. Event handling integration
3. Direct controller usage
4. Vim mode support
