# Phase 3 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the Web UI to use the shared ui-core controller, making it downstream of the TUI architecture while maintaining all Web-specific features.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Controller Integration
- Added ui-core dependency to package.json
- Replaced SpreadsheetStateMachine with SpreadsheetController from ui-core
- Integrated the controller into CanvasGrid and main.ts

### 2. State Management
- Created WebStateAdapter to bridge ui-core state with Web UI needs
- Implemented mouse-to-keyboard action mapping
- Maintained Web-specific features like interaction modes (normal vs keyboard-only)

### 3. Component Updates
- **KeyboardHandler**: Now delegates all vim key handling to the controller
- **CellEditor**: Simplified to work with controller state, removed local vim behavior
- **ModeIndicator**: Updated to work with UIState from ui-core
- **Viewport**: Implements ViewportManager interface for controller compatibility

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Removed GridVimBehavior.ts (functionality now in ui-core)
- Removed ResizeBehavior.ts (functionality now in ui-core)
- Removed SpreadsheetStateMachine.ts and related tests
- Removed visual mode test files that referenced GridVimBehavior

### 5. Feature Preservation
- All vim navigation and editing modes work through the controller
- Mouse interactions are converted to keyboard commands maintaining vim behavior
- Resize functionality works for both keyboard and mouse
- Interaction mode toggle (normal/keyboard-only) preserved as Web UI feature

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Code Reuse**: Web UI now uses the same vim behavior logic as TUI
2. **Consistency**: Both UIs have identical keyboard behavior
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for UI logic in ui-core
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features to both UIs through the controller

## Testing
- All existing unit tests pass
- Created integration tests to verify controller functionality
- Type checking passes with no errors
- Build completes successfully

## Next Steps
The Web UI is now successfully downstream of the TUI architecture. Future enhancements can be made in the ui-core package and will automatically benefit both UIs.
